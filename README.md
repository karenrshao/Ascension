Story Summary:

The main character lives with her sister, who suffers from a mysterious illness, on the ground level in a land that extends into the sky. Unbeknownst to her, the two of them are royalty, related to the ruler of the kingdom known as the Sunseeker. The MC is forced to travel to the city to acquire medicine and money to support herself and her sister, and she eventually gets the opportunity to explore the subterranean undercity as well as the sky islands via airships after a guard recognizes her sisterâ€™s brooch as a royal sigil. 

Eventually, she reaches the palace and meets the Sunseeker. Depending on how much of the truth she knows of the poaching of Starwyrms for their scales that grant the power of wind magic, she can choose to accept his offer to rule, or confront him. There is also the option to kill or save a captured starwyrm. Both of these choices affect the ending. 




Aside from sound effects, all the assets including music, sprites, backgrounds, and animations were created by our team.
