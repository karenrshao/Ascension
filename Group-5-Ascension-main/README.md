Milestone 4 - New Features
- Numerous sophisticated integrated assets
    - Every character, level, and background in our game has been handdrawn and painted
    - We also used music mixing to mix between a combat and a default track for each of our regions, each of which having unique tracks for the different states. 
- Particle System
    - Implemented a rudimentary particle system for footsteps, breaking boxes, and summoning rocks
- Game Balance
    - Game was shared with multiple people and asked for their feedback
    - Updated the combat system and quest system to make controls as well as movement more clear
    - Updated the way quests are displayed (to make it more legible) and added a map of the world
    - Added a user control screen with the buttons in case the player forgets which key does what

Milestone 3 - New Features
- Sound effects: landing (after jumping high enough), interacting with objects, attacking enemies, getting hurt, etc.
- Self-composed background music
- Serialization: persistence between levels, progression, saving and loading the game. 
- Complex, branching quest and dialogue system: 
    - Quests have 3 stages; a beginning stage, when the quest is initiated; a during stage, while the quest is ongoing; and an end stage, when the requirements for the quest is complete. Our quests use a directed graph structure, so completing quests unlock new quests that can be started either directly afterwards, or by exploring and interacting with different people around town.
    - Auto-triggered dialogue to play small cut-scenes, for forced interactions with certain NPCs or characters
    - Decisive quests, in which a player’s choice locks down the later progression of the game. Branching outcomes allow us to sculpt and shape the game and story based on the player’s actions in the game.
- Enemy AI:
    - Bird-type Enemy, automatically spaces itself above the player and patrolling above. Occasionally drops projectiles on the player that lasts for a bit before disappearing.
    - Guard-type Enemy, with a detection system that will investigate any decoys thrown within a wider radius than its chase-detection radius.
